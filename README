Summary
-------
webOS Localization tool

Description
-----------
The webOS Localization tool is used to generate string resources.
This extracts localizable string from your source codes and translation files,
writes out string resources in various format.
Translation files should be XLIFF 2.0 format.

How to get your strings localized in the build
-----------
In order to get your app localized, you need to inherit 'webos_localizable' in your recipe file.
The class causes the localization tool to run in the build:
     inherit webos_localizable
If Qt/QML app, inheric 'webos_qt_localization' instead of 'webos_localizable':
     inherit webos_qt_localization

And you should prepare XLIFF files which have translations
http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/xliff-core-v2.0.html

XLIFF files path also needs to be added to your recipe file:
     WEBOS_LOCALIZATION_DATA_PATH = "[your_xliff_path]"
     WEBOS_LOCALIZATION_XLIFF_BASENAME = "[your_module_name]"
